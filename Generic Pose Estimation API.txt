provide an image in the form of: byte array reference or GPU texture reference; with specifier of reference type

Set a flag for the preferred processor to use when procesing the pose estimation (GPU, CPU, or NPU) - this will fallback to CPU if GPU or NPU fails.

Request pose data from the provided image, and get back a struct similar to:
struct Joints
{
	Vector3 LeftFoot;
	Vector3 LeftKnee;
	Vector3 LeftHip;
	Vector3 RightFoot;
	Vector3 RightKnee;
	Vector3 RightHip;
	Vector3 SpineLower
	Vector3 SpineMiddle
	Vector3 SpineTop;
	Vector3 Neck;
	Vector3 Head;
	Vector3 RightShoulder;
	Vector3 RightElbow;
	Vector3 RightWrist;
	Vector3 RightHand;
	Vector3 LeftShoulder;
	Vector3 LeftElbow;
	Vector3 LeftWrist;
	Vector3 LeftHand;
}
